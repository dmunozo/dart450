This projects explores the concept of story-telling in the web, by engaging the user
in a story about a sailor that navegates the web without understanding the reasons
why he is there, doing what he is doing.

The website is a landing page with different paragraphs puting the story together
the content of the paragraphs is controlled by a series of functions that use arrays to
populate the <p> tags on the HTML. Also I am using a JQuery pluggin to control the movement
of the elements that contain the webpage.

Different graphics made by myself are placed along the webpage to create a sense
of tranquility and easy navigation, which reflects the story of the main character
going through the web.

The story loops continously to the begining of the page where the story starts.
Ending in the beginning and explaining why the main character feels he is
chained to a loop.

I wanted to represent and combine the two aspects of my persona in this project:

1) The fact that I love to create stories and experiment with different mediums
to tell them, I love movie-making and animation, as well as drawing scenarios
and combining them with tangeable experiences where the user interact with the story.

2) My passion for Design and aesthetic arts.
