Assigment 02 :: Macondo

Macondo is a website coded using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This
project is a web intervention that explores the fast and superficial interaction we have
with the Internet. Produced for Dart 450, Web Intervention.


Inspired by the novel 100 Years of Solitude written by the Colombian author and Nobel
price of literature Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Macondo tells the story of a young
indigenous man of the Arahuaco community who leaves its tribe in the mountains in
order to go to the city, learn the new technologies of the modern society and bring this
knowledge with him back to the tribe. The events in the story are depicted in the
webpage through hand-drawn landscapes and characters. In the background my voice
narrates the story and provides instructions to navigate the website. The user is asked
to solve small puzzles and patiently interact with the webpage in order to move on the
story. The playfulness aspect of the webpage intends to slow down the interaction
between the user and the piece, it forces it to admire the illustrations, to stop and hear
the words, not being able to advance without listening to the whole recording. It is an
analogy to the act of reading. It is an in-built correlation with literature as well as a
critique to the fast web and our ephemeral relation with our information and the
mediums that provide it.


This project is in some way an autobiographical story, which symbolizes my own
departing from Colombia and my arrival to a different culture. It is also a homage to the
literature and the traditions of my country. This work explores several Jqury Libraries on the web
Scrollmagic, Responsive Vioce, Animation. This piece of code is an
invitation to everyone who experiences the webpage to explore the mysticism and
magic realism that defines Colombia and its people. It is intended to be colorful and
mysterious, to evoke the magic and the folklore of the indigenous peoples from the
North coast of Colombia, their stories and their legends.
Macondo is still being built, and it probably will continue being built for a while, it is
indeed a graphic and interactive representation of my own story, and my story is still
being coded.
